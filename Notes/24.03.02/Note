css work like clockwise top-right-bottom-left - attachment
Try to reduce lines in meaningfull way


search about css box model

padding-space between content and boarder
margin- space between elements



when there is two margins in two elements it take the highest value as the margin


sometime by default html add margins to elements (by defualt 8px)
you can remove it using margin 0


you can add multiple class as well
 <div class="box-1 box"> in here box-1 and box are separate classes


dont use important its because when troubleshooting its hard


CSS Units
1)Precentage - change according to the web browser window size
2)Pixel - stays the same


<hr> tag ---- horizontal rule can get a horizontal line



in lesson-css-unit.html prestnage box change its values according to the parent element
thats why it change in first one and not in second one.  In the second one it has a fixed values


3)Rem

rem is a fixed value set on browser so you can  change it on each devices

2rem = 1rem*2;
3rem = 1rem*3;

as you can see it change according to browser default font size
